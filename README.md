# ByteShell
ByteShell is a simple shell implementation written in C language. It provides a basic command-line interface where users can enter commands, execute built-in commands, and view command history.

## Features

1. Command execution: Execute commands entered by the user.

2. Built-in commands: Supports a set of built-in commands such as **cd, alias, help, echo, printf, readarray,** etc.

3. Command history: Stores a history of executed commands and provides the history command to view the command history.

4. Basic shell loop: Provides a continuous shell loop where users can enter commands repeatedly until they choose to exit.
